# System level tests for Marketstore


These tests are initially implemented test tick support in the published Marketstore docker image.

Initial tests:
- download and run latest marketstore docker image
- import of tick data using csv files import
- writing and querying ticks with pymarketstore client

This is a work in progress and tests will be modified or added according to the set of features we wish to monitor.

## Connection Test
- Command
```
make -C tests/integ connect
```

## WIP

### test_import_csv
- Command
```
make -C tests/integ test_import_csv_1
make -C tests/integ test_import_csv_2
```

- Status: **FAILING**

The latest versions of Marketstore have a broken client interface for loading files

### test pymarketstore client

- Command
```
make -C tests/integ test_client
```

- Status: 100% **FAILING** (since precision is not enough)

```

tests/test_ticks.py::test_integrity[TEST_MILLISECOND_EPOCH_SAME_TIMEFRAME] FAILED [100%]
```

The python write interface does not accept Epochs with precision more than a second. To get around this limitation, we have to change the client:

For **write**, we should implement a logic similar to the csv reader.

For **read** operations, we could read the protected field `Nanoseconds` and add it to the index when found in the queried data.
