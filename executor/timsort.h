/**
 * A stable, adaptive, iterative mergesort that requires far fewer than
 * n lg(n) comparisons when running on partially sorted arrays, while
 * offering performance comparable to a traditional mergesort when run
 * on random arrays.  Like all proper mergesorts, this sort is stable and
 * runs O(n log n) time (worst case).  In the worst case, this sort requires
 * temporary storage space for n/2 object references; in the best case,
 * it requires only a small constant amount of space.
 *
 * This implementation was adapted from Josh Bloch's Java implementation of
 * Tim Peters's list sort for Python, which is described in detail here:
 *
 *   http://svn.python.org/projects/python/trunk/Objects/listsort.txt
 *
 * Tim's C code may be found here:

 *
 *   http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/jsr166/src/main/java/util/TimSort.java?view=co
 *
 * The underlying techniques are described in this paper (and may have
 * even earlier origins):
 *
 *  "Optimistic Sorting and Information Theoretic Complexity"
 *  Peter McIlroy
 *  SODA (Fourth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms),
 *  pp 467-474, Austin, Texas, 25-27 January 1993.
 *
 * While the API to this class consists solely of static methods, it is
 * (privately) instantiable; a TimSort instance holds the state of an ongoing
 * sort, assuming the input array is large enough to warrant the full-blown
 * TimSort. Small arrays are sorted in place, using a binary insertion sort.
