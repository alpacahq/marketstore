# Alpaca Broker API Feeder

* This plugin retrieves quotes data for all symbols in (a) specified exchange(s) by [Alpaca Broker API](https://alpaca.markets/docs/broker/market-data/) and store it to the local marketstore server.
* You need an API Key ID and API Secret Key to call Alpaca API. Please sign up for Alpaca and generate your API keys first to use this plugin.
* This plugin is able to collect daily candlestick chart data for specified date ranges and backfill it to the local marketstore too. This historical backfill process is run at marketstore startup and at the configured time everyday (see `update_time` config )

## Example configuration
```yaml
bgworkers:
  # -----------------------
  # AlpacaBrokerAPIFeeder gets the realtime/historical stock data
  # by Alpaca Broker API (https://alpaca.markets/docs/broker/)
  # and writes it to the local marketstore at fixed intervals.
  # -----------------------
  - module: alpacabkfeeder.so
    config:
      # exchange list
      exchanges:
        # - AMEX
        # - ARCA
        # - BATS
        # - NYSE
        - NASDAQ
        # - NYSEARCA
      # time when target symbols in the exchanges are updated every day.
      # this time is also used for the historical data back-fill.
      # This config can be manually overridden by "ALPACA_BROKER_FEEDER_UPDATE_TIME" environmental variable.
      update_time: "13:30:00" # (UTC). = every day at 08:30:00 (EST)

      # The data-feeding is executed when 'minute' of the current time matches off_hours_schedule

      # Numbers separated by commas are allowed.  Example: "0,15,30,45" -> execute every 15 minutes.
      # Whitespaces are ignored.
      # If both off_hours_interval and off_hours_schedule are specified at the same time,
      # off_hours_interval will be ignored.
