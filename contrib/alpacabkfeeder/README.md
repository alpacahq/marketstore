# Alpaca Broker API Feeder

* This plugin retrieves quotes data for all symbols in (a) specified exchange(s) by [Alpaca Broker API](https://alpaca.markets/docs/broker/market-data/) and store it to the local marketstore server.
* You need an API Key ID and API Secret Key to call Alpaca API. Please sign up for Alpaca and generate your API keys first to use this plugin.
* This plugin is able to collect daily candlestick chart data for specified date ranges and backfill it to the local marketstore too. This historical backfill process is run at marketstore startup and at the configured time everyday (see `update_time` config )

## Example configuration
```yaml
bgworkers:
  # -----------------------
  # AlpacaBrokerAPIFeeder gets the realtime/historical stock data
  # by Alpaca Broker API (https://alpaca.markets/docs/broker/)
  # and writes it to the local marketstore at fixed intervals.
  # -----------------------
  - module: alpacabkfeeder.so
    config:
      # exchange list
      exchanges:
        # - AMEX
        # - ARCA
        # - BATS
        # - NYSE
        - NASDAQ
        # - NYSEARCA
        # - OTC
      # (optional) time when the list of target symbols (tradable stocks) are updated every day.
      # This config can be manually overridden by "ALPACA_BROKER_FEEDER_SYMBOLS_UPDATE_TIME" environmental variable.
      #symbols_update_time: "13:00:00" # (UTC). = every day at 08:00:00 (EST)
      # time when the historical data back-fill is run.
      # This config can be manually overridden by "ALPACA_BROKER_FEEDER_UPDATE_TIME" environmental variable.
      update_time: "13:30:00" # (UTC). = every day at 08:30:00 (EST)
      # (optional) When stocks_json_url is specified, Alpaca Broker feeder retrieves data for only the stocks
      # written in the json file.
      # The example json file structure:
      # {
      #  "data": {
      #    "AAPL": {...},
      #    "ACN": {...},
      #    "ADBE": {...}
      #   }
      # }
      # In this case, Alpaca broker feeder gets "AAPL", "ACN", and "ADBE"'s data only.
      # Any object under each symbol name is ignored.
      # This config can be manually overridden by "ALPACA_BROKER_FEEDER_STOCKS_JSON_URL"
      stocks_json_url: "https://example.com/tradable_stocks.json"
      # (optional) If the stocks_json file is authorized by basic auth,
      # please specify "{user}:{pass}" (e.g. "john:mypassword").
      # This config can be manually overridden by "ALPACA_BROKER_FEEDER_STOCKS_JSON_BASIC_AUTH"
      stocks_json_basic_auth: "user:pass"

      # This config can be manually overridden by "ALPACA_BROKER_FEEDER_API_KEY_ID" and "ALPACA_BROKER_FEEDER_API_SECRET_KEY"
      # environment variables.

      # Timeout: Due to the restriction of the Alpaca API Client library used in this plugin,
      # Alpaca API Client timeout can be updated only by "APCA_API_CLIENT_TIMEOUT" environmental variable.
      # Please set the env var to a duration string is a possibly signed sequence of
      # decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix,
      # such as "300ms", "5.5s" if you want to change it from the default 10sec timeout.
      # Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
